# ML-Models
This Repo contains various machine learning models and data preprocessing scripts that can be easily applied to a wide range of datasets.

Models include:
### Regression 
* Simple
* Multiple
* Polynomial
* SVR 
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

### Classification 
* Logistic Regression
* K-NN
* SVM
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

### Deep Learning in Keras 
* Artificial Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network

More models to come as I do more of the course lol

I wrote these scripts with the help of the Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy.
